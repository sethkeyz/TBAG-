# TBAG-

Aaron, my TBAG game is limited in its functionality, as you'll see. For example, if you try to open the door without the key the game finishes, and likewise when you say 'no' to opening the locked door. But if you take the right journey, the game does all that was asked, i.e. first collect the key from a room and then unlock the door to another and interact with that room's character. 

I appreciate it's limited, but i couldn't manage to loop it in a way that makes it flexible (i.e. being able to try and open the door, and if you don't have the key then the door stays closed, and the room is not displayed). Would be great to know how i could have done that in your feedback.
