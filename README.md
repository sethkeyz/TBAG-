# TBAG-

Aaron, my TBAG game is limited in its functionality, as you'll see. For example, if you try to open the door without the key the game finishes, and likewise when you say 'no' to opening the locked door. But if you take the right journey, the game does all that was asked, i.e. collect a key from a room and then unlock the door to another and interact with that room's character.
